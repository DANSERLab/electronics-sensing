# Braingeneers `Sense` API

`Sense` is the base API for Braingeneers' various data aggregation platforms. Our goal is to unify the basic ADC process to allow for the same code to be shared across multiple, different devices. For instance, if two organoids are grown in the same well, but one is under a 4-electrode regime and the other a 32-electrode, `Sense` can be configured to scale the data output for the second well to group those 16 channels into one data set.
